<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>My name is LuChenjie. This is my blog which powered by Jeklly and hosted by GitHub.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to build a blog site. Why I choose GitHub+Jeklly? Because with GitHub and Jeklly, you can easily add a post like pushing an update in Git. And also GitHub can be vistied with less latency almost all around the world. Last but not the least, GitHub provide me a free domain lcjfly.github.io !</p>
